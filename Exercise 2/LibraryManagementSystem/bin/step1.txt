Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
Ans->
1.Linear Search
Description: A straightforward search algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) (if the element is the first one)
Average Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n) (if the element is not present)

2. Binary Search
Description: A more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists. It divides the search interval in half repeatedly, comparing the target value to the middle element of the list.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) (if the middle element is the target)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n) (if the search space is reduced to one element)
