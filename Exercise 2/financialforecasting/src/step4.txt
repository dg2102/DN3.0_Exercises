
o	Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
Ans->
Time Complexity: O(n)
Explanation: The function makes a single recursive call for each year, leading to a linear number of calls proportional to the number of years. Each call performs a constant amount of work (calculating the future value)

o	Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
ans->
To avoid excessive computation and improve efficiency, we can use memoization to store previously computed results. This prevents recalculating the future value for the same parameters multiple times.
