Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
Ans->
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It typically has a base case to terminate the recursion and prevent infinite loops.

Recursion can simplify complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. This is particularly useful in problems like tree traversals, factorial calculations, and Fibonacci sequence generation.
