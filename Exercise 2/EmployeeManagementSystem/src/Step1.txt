
Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.
Ans->
Contiguous Memory Allocation: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, meaning that each element is placed directly next to the previous one. This allows for efficient access to elements via their index.
Fixed Size: The size of an array must be defined at the time of its creation, and it cannot be changed dynamically. This can lead to wasted space if the array is not fully utilized or to the need for creating a new, larger array if more space is needed.
Direct Access: Arrays allow for constant time complexity O(1) for accessing elements by index, making them very efficient for read operations.

Advantages of array:-
Fast Access: Direct access to elements using their index allows for quick retrieval.
Memory Efficiency: Since arrays are allocated in contiguous memory, they can be more memory-efficient for storing multiple elements of the same type.
Simplicity: Arrays are simple to use and understand, making them a good choice for straightforward data storage needs.
