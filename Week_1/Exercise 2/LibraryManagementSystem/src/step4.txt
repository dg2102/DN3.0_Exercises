o	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
Ans->
Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1) (if the book is the first one)
Average Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n) (if the book is not present)

Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1) (if the middle element is the target)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n) (if the search space reduces to one element)

o	Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.
Ans->
Linear Search:
Use when the dataset is small or unsorted.
Suitable for cases where you may need to search through all elements.
Simpler to implement and does not require sorting.

Binary Search:
Use when the dataset is large and sorted.
More efficient than linear search in terms of time complexity.
Requires additional overhead for sorting if the data is not sorted, but once sorted, it allows for very fast searches.
