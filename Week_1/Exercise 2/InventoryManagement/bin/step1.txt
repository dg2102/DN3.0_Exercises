Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.

Ans->Data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories for several reasons:

1.Efficiency: Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial for quick access to inventory data, especially when dealing with large datasets.
2.Scalability: As the inventory grows, the chosen data structures must scale effectively to accommodate more products without significant performance degradation.
3.Operations: Common operations such as adding, updating, and deleting products must be optimized to minimize time complexity, ensuring that the system remains responsive.

Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

Ans->For an inventory management system, the following data structures are suitable:

ArrayList: Useful for maintaining an ordered list of products. It provides fast access by index but can be slow for insertions and deletions.
HashMap: Ideal for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions by product ID. It allows for constant time complexity on average for these operations.
TreeMap: Useful if you need to maintain a sorted order of products based on product IDs or names, but operations will be slower than HashMap due to its O(log n) complexity for insertions and lookups.
